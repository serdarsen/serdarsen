#### Hi! &nbsp; <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25"> </samp> 

I have over five years of experience working with Java, with specific expertise in the Spring Framework for over a year. I have more than three years of experience in developing and deploying web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Java, and SQL databases. Additionally, I have experience in implementing responsive design using CSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS as well as integrating APIs and third-party libraries.

While my passion lies in developing applications with React, I am always eager to expand my skill set and take on new challenges. I am open and willing to work with Angular and Vue applications, as long as I have the opportunity to continue working with React as well. I believe that each framework has its strengths and benefits, and I am excited to learn and grow with any of them.

I have developed applications using Spring Framework's default security configurations and have a solid understanding of secure software design. However, I am committed to continually improving my knowledge of web application security and am currently honing my skills by reading NextAuth.js documentation. I recognize the importance of building secure applications and am eager to expand my knowledge of industry-standard security practices such as OWASP.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a natural problem-solver who enjoys using technology to find optimal solutions. I am always eager to tackle the next challenge and find creative solutions to complex problems. Whether it's debugging code, writing scripts, or collaborating with teammates to solve a difficult technical issue, I am always willing to dive in and lend a hand. I work well in a team environment and am committed to collaborating with my colleagues to ensure that we deliver high-quality solutions that meet our clients' evolving needs.

I am excited to contribute my experience and knowledge to the success of your team, and I am willing to learn and adapt to new technologies as needed. While I communicate in English, I am open to feedback and support from colleagues, and I am committed to continually improving my language skills to better collaborate with my teammates.
